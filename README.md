# os-challenge
Our solution to the os challenge we competed in our opearating systems course

The challenge was to write a server app that takes ftp requests of a hash value and finds the number that produced it.
The complexity was to write the app in the most efficient way possible. Our work resulted in us storing some of the results in a very efficient hashmap, giving requests estimated priorities and using multi threading efficiently.

Our solution became the #1 on the rankings, where over 30 groups competed.
